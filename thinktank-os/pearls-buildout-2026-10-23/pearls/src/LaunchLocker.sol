///        non-existent one. `withdrawPrincipal` reverts unconditionally.

///        (factory-validated ≥ 180 days after launch) and then pays the

///
///      LP fees, per the launch's frozen choice:
///      - CreatorClaimable: `collectFees()` pulls accrued fees from the
///        position and forwards them to the creator. Principal never moves.
///      - DeadCompounded: `collectFees()` reverts. Fees remain inside the
///        position, compounding. Nothing is burned by the locker because the
///        locker never holds fee tokens in this mode.
