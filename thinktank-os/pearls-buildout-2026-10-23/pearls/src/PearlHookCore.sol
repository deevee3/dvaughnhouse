/// @title PearlHookCore
/// @notice ALL of the PearlHook's accounting, with none of the v4 plumbing:
///         cumulative quote volume, the $10M volume gate, the 0.3% quote-side
///         fee, and the launch-window max-swap guard. One instance per pool.
///
/// @dev PROTOTYPE — unaudited, testnet only. THIS IS THE RISK CENTRE'S
///      TESTABLE HALF (spec §7). The other half — resolving a raw v4 swap
///      into the correct `quoteAmount` across the four direction cases and
///      settling the fee inside the PoolManager unlock context — lives in
///      the PearlHook adapter and is INCOMPLETE by design in this repo.
///
///      Trust shape: the only address that can report swaps is the immutable
///      `poolReporter`. The PearlHook adapter deploys this core in its own
///      constructor and names itself — so the wiring cannot be wrong, cannot
///      be re-pointed, and needs no setter anywhere. The certificate prints
///      both addresses.
///
///      Fee semantics (spec §6.2/§6.3):
///      - The swap that CROSSES the gate pays no fee. Fees apply only when
///        cumulative volume was already >= threshold before the swap.
///      - fee = quoteAmount * 30 / 10_000, integer division rounding DOWN
///        (trader's favour), computed on the quote side only.
///      - `recordSwap` RETURNS the fee owed; moving the actual quote tokens
///        to the treasury is the adapter's settlement job, because ERC-20
///        transfers are not how v4 hooks take fees (spec §7.2). The core
///        does track `totalFeesQuote` so the amount owed is auditable
///        on-chain even before settlement lands.
