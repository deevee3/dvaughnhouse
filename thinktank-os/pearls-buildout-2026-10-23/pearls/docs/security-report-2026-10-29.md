## 4. Adversarial Fork Test Attack Matrix

Attacker-perspective tests were executed against the Base Sepolia Uniswap v4 deployment (`PoolManager` `0x05E73354cFDd6745C338b50BcFDfA3Aa6fA03408`) in [`test/PearlAdversarialFork.t.sol`](../test/PearlAdversarialFork.t.sol). In every scenario, the attack was proven to fail cleanly without compromising safety invariants:

### 4.1 Fee Bypass Attacks
1. **`test_adversarial_fee_bypass_below_gate_cannot_extract_fees`**
   - *Attack:* Attacker executes multiple trades below the $10M cumulative volume threshold attempting to trigger premature fee collection.
   - *Result:* `feeActive` remains `false`. Treasury quote balance $\Delta = 0$. Launched token balance $\Delta = 0$.
2. **`test_adversarial_crossing_swap_not_double_counted`**
   - *Attack:* Attacker executes the exact gate-crossing swap and attempts to trigger retroactive taxation or double-counting.
   - *Result:* Gate-crossing swap pays strictly $0$ fee. Subsequent swap pays exact 30 bps fee without double-counting crossing volume.
3. **`test_adversarial_quote_orientation_confusion`**
   - *Attack:* Attacker constructs pool with quote as `currency0` attempting to trick hook into taxing the launched token (`currency1`).
   - *Result:* Fee is extracted strictly in `currency0` (quote asset). Treasury launched token balance remains $0$.
4. **`test_adversarial_fee_asset_substitution`**
   - *Attack:* Attacker attempts to divert or substitute launched token for quote fees.
   - *Result:* `PoolManager.take` routes strictly the quote currency to the treasury Safe.

### 4.2 Launch Guard Attacks
5. **`test_adversarial_max_swap_guard_blocks_whale_buy`**
   - *Attack:* Sniping bot attempts an oversize buy (`maxSwapQuoteAmount + 1`) during the configured guard window.
   - *Result:* Reverts with `PearlHookCore.SwapTooLarge`.
6. **`test_adversarial_max_swap_guard_expires_cleanly`**
   - *Attack:* Attacker tests trade execution immediately after the guard window expires (`block.number > launchBlock + maxSwapBlocks`).
   - *Result:* Swaps exceeding earlier cap execute cleanly with zero restriction.
7. **`test_adversarial_token_cap_bypass_blocked`**
   - *Attack:* Attacker attempts secondary-market accumulation exceeding the 2% per-wallet holding cap during the `walletCapBlocks` window.
   - *Result:* Reverts with `LaunchToken.WalletCapExceeded`.
8. **`test_adversarial_guard_boundary_enforcement`**
   - *Attack:* Attacker probes boundary blocks (`launchBlock + maxSwapBlocks` vs. `launchBlock + maxSwapBlocks + 1`).
   - *Result:* Reverts at the exact boundary block; succeeds at block $+1$.

### 4.3 Locker Attacks
9. **`test_adversarial_locker_abyssal_principal_withdrawal_fails`**
   - *Attack:* Attacker (and creator) attempts to call `withdrawPrincipal()` on an Abyssal locker.
   - *Result:* Reverts with `LaunchLocker.AbyssalNeverUnlocks`.
10. **`test_adversarial_locker_timed_early_withdrawal_fails`**
    - *Attack:* Creator attempts premature withdrawal before `unlockTime`.
    - *Result:* Reverts with `LaunchLocker.StillLocked`.
11. **`test_adversarial_locker_timed_non_creator_cannot_withdraw`**
    - *Attack:* Unauthorized third-party attempts to withdraw principal after `unlockTime`.
    - *Result:* Reverts with `LaunchLocker.NotCreator`.
12. **`test_adversarial_locker_deposit_reentry_blocked`**
    - *Attack:* Attacker attempts to overwrite or re-enter `deposit()` on an active locker.
    - *Result:* Reverts with `LaunchLocker.AlreadyHasPosition`.
13. **`test_adversarial_locker_compounded_fee_collection_blocked`**
    - *Attack:* Attacker attempts fee collection on a `DeadCompounded` LP lock.
    - *Result:* Reverts with `LaunchLocker.FeesAreDeadCompounded`.

### 4.4 Callback Abuse & Spoofing
14. **`test_adversarial_direct_callbacks_not_from_pm_revert`**
    - *Attack:* Attacker calls `PearlHook.beforeSwap` or `afterSwap` directly bypassing `PoolManager`.
    - *Result:* Reverts with `PearlHook.NotPoolManager`.
15. **`test_adversarial_unmined_hook_deployment_reverts`**
    - *Attack:* Attacker deploys `PearlHook` using standard `new` without mining required low-14-bit permission flags.
    - *Result:* Constructor reverts with `Hooks.HookAddressNotValid`.
16. **`test_adversarial_unauthorized_record_swap_on_core_reverts`**
    - *Attack:* Attacker calls `PearlHookCore.recordSwap` directly bypassing the adapter.
    - *Result:* Reverts with `PearlHookCore.NotReporter`.

## 5. Static Analysis Triage (Aderyn & Slither)

### 5.1 Aderyn (`0.6.8`) Findings & Dispositions

| ID | Detector | Severity | Location | Disposition & Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **H-1** | ETH transferred without address checks | High | `AirdropDistributor.claim`, `VestingVault.release` | **False Positive.** Neither function transfers native ETH; both transfer ERC-20 tokens via `safeTransfer(account, amount)` and `safeTransfer(beneficiary, amount)`. Recipient addresses are authenticated via Merkle proofs (`claim`) or immutable contract state (`beneficiary`). |
| **H-2** | Reentrancy: State change after external call | High | `LaunchLocker.deposit` | **False Positive.** The external call is `IERC721(collection).ownerOf(tokenId) != address(this)`, which is a read-only view check. `deposit` is protected by OpenZeppelin's `nonReentrant` modifier and a one-shot `hasPosition` guard. |
| **L-1** | Large Numeric Literal | Low | `LaunchFactory`, `PearlHook`, `PearlHookCore` | **Accepted / Design.** Denominator `10_000` (100.00% bps) and Uniswap v4 fee tier `10000` (1.00%) represent standard domain constants. |
| **L-2** | Literal Instead of Constant | Low | `AirdropDistributor`, `LaunchFactory`, `PearlHook` | **Accepted / Informational.** Standard bit shifts (`128`, `256`) and fee rate constants (`30`) are documented inline. |
| **L-3** | PUSH0 Opcode | Low | All contracts (`pragma ^0.8.24`) | **Accepted.** Base Sepolia and Base Mainnet EVM execution environments natively support `PUSH0` (Cancun EVM). |
| **L-4** | Unchecked Return Value | Low | `LaunchFactory._validate` (`getTickSpacing`) | **Accepted / Design.** `getTickSpacing` reverts with `InvalidPoolFeeTier` on invalid tiers; returned `tickSpacing` is deliberately used for validation side effects. |
| **L-5** | Unspecific Solidity Pragma | Low | All contracts | **Accepted.** Pinned to exact compiler `solc 0.8.24` via `foundry.toml`. |

### 5.2 Slither (`0.11.6`) Findings & Dispositions

- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 0
- **Low / Informational:** 13 findings across 6 detector categories:
  - `incorrect-equality`: `VestingVault.release()` (`amount == 0`) — **By design.** Reverts with `NothingToRelease()` on zero-value releases.
  - `reentrancy-events`: Events emitted after external transfers (`claim`, `collectFees`, `withdrawPrincipal`, `release`, `launch`) — **Safe.** State mutations occur strictly before calls; entrypoints carry `nonReentrant`.
  - `timestamp`: Comparisons against multi-day lock durations (≥180-day floor) — **Acceptable.** Sequencer drift is negligible.
  - `assembly`: Memory-safe assembly in `HookMiner.find` — **Reviewed & Safe.** Uses a fixed 85-byte scratchpad to prevent quadratic memory expansion.
  - `cyclomatic-complexity`: Sequential validation in `LaunchFactory._validate` — **Acceptable.** Upfront parameter sanity checking.
  - `too-many-digits`: Address bitmasks and CREATE2 prefixes — **Acceptable.** Standard Ethereum EVM constants.

## 6. Known Limitations & Pre-Deployment Gates

1. **Third-Party External Audit:**
   No independent third-party audit firm has reviewed these contracts. Formal verification and static analysis significantly mitigate common vulnerabilities, but do not replace an external audit before mainnet deployment.
2. **Multi-Network `PoolManager` Parameterization:**
   `LaunchFactory.POOL_MANAGER` is currently bound as an immutable constant to Base Sepolia (`0x05E73354cFDd6745C338b50BcFDfA3Aa6fA03408`). Multi-chain/mainnet parameterization is deferred to Phase 3 per project scheduling.
3. **Rehearsal Deployment Gate:**
   Deployment to live networks is hard-gated on D'Vaughn's explicit authorization with a dedicated throwaway test Safe.
